### HG? RG? Gunpla? What is it all about?

In short, _gunpla_ means plastic kits of humanoid robots. They come in different scales and level of detail. It's similar to aeroplane/train plastic kits, but instead of existing technology, gunpla portrays fictional bipedal robots from _Gundam_ media franchise. [This page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunpla/wiki/general_info) should give you more detailed overview.

### Where do I buy gunpla? Which is the best store for me?

It depends on your location. Most people buy online, either at reseller or at an international store shipping from Japan. If you go with a reseller, be prepared to pay more than the kit costs in Japan. If you go with a store shipping from Japan, be prepared to pay import fees/taxes.

Some popular stores include:

* [HLJ](http://hlj.com/)
* [Hobby Search](http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/)
* [Amiami](http://amiami.com/)

Another option is shopping locally. While the prices may not be the best, you have the advantage of talking with experienced workers and possibly joining "Gundam/Gunpla Clubs" where you can socialize about Gunpla. [A WIP list of local retailers is available here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gunpla/wiki/local)
### What tools do I need?

If this is your first kit, you'll do fine with some sort of flat cutter and a hobby knife. If you want to get an "essential" set of tools, check out [this page](http://goodguydangunpla.blogspot.ie/2012/07/gunpla-tools-for-beginners.html). Remember that you can spend arbitrary amount of money on tools, as the gunpla industry knows well how to squeeze their customers for money. Some of them are worth the price, some of them are not.

### Which model should I get? What's the best MG/RG/PG/HG?

There are no "best" kits. If you've watched the anime, go for a kit of mobile suit you've seen in action. If you haven't, pick something that you like the looks of. In both cases, visit [dalong](http://dalong.net) to check out photos of snap-fits of most contemporary gunpla.

There are some kits that are considered "problematic" due to some design issues. [This page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunpla/wiki/problematic_kits) has a community-aggregated list.

### I want a gunpla for my wife/girlfriend/cousin/generic-person-not-interested-in-gunpla, what should I get them?

See the question above. Have them visit [dalong](http://dalong.net) and pick something that they like the looks of.

###I completed the model, but there are leftover parts not mentioned in the manual###
They should be marked with an X on the parts list page of the instructions manual, meaning they are not needed for the model. The reason for why they are there is because the runner shares the same one with another model kit due to similarities and to reduce cost on making new moulds.

###I lost the instructions manual###
You can look for the instruction manuals on sites such as [Hobby Search](http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/gundam/) or [Dalong](http://www.dalong.net/).

### What can I do to make my kit look better?

Usually kits will look quite nice after you put them together (so called snap-fit build). There's a large number of things you can do to make it look even better. [This page](http://otakurevolution.com/content/laymans-gunpla-guide-gunpla-flowchart) shows some of the most popular things to do. Remember it's your kit, and you don't *have* to do any of this - it's all about your creativity and what you consider to be "good looking". Having said so, there's certain consensus as to what's worth doing to most kits; panel lining and decals are the usual choice.

### I'm done with my kit! Now what?

[Post pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpla) here! We love to see efforts of people work. Consider taking some pictures in good lighting with gunpla [posed in an interesting way](http://lightning-ace.blogspot.it/2012/12/q-some-gunpla-posing-advices.html).

### Where do I store my completed kits?

If you want to display them, Ikea's Detolf is a popular display cabinet. It's relatively cheap, sturdy and will easily host 16 HGs in uncluttered way. You can also get lighting systems for it in Ikea, although they're not cheap. If you're not afraid of DIY, consider using [LED strips to light it up](http://gcu.tactical-grace.net/2014/08/wild-led-strip-appears/).

### What do I do with boxes and/or empty sprues?

Some people throw them away. Some people cut up the boxes and preserve the artwork to display on the wall or to use them in different places. Some people make [Gundam figures out of runners](http://blog.goo.ne.jp/hirotyun1000/e/002a577eec67f7a431036217ff6e5bd1). We're a weird bunch.

### I'm going to Japan! What are the stores/places I should visit?

* [Gundam Front Tokyo](http://gundamfront-tokyo.com/en/) located on [Odaiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odaiba) - 1/1 RX-78-2 statue, visitor center, gunpla exhibit, apparel store. Heaven, in short. :)
* Akihabara - Tokyo district, home to all things manga and anime. Recommended stores that have knowledgable staff, cheap prices and good selection: Yodobashi Camera, Asobit, Mandarake (older/specialty kits), Hobby-off
